# When to Pre-Train Graph Neural Networks? From Data Generation Perspective!
### Introduction
 This project is the implementation of paper â€œWhen to Pre-Train Graph Neural Networks? From Data Generation Perspective!" accepted by KDD2023. In this code repository we provide:

### Setup
The script has been tested running under Python 3.6.5, with the following packages installed (along with their dependencies):

`pytorch 1.6.0+cu101`

`torch-geometric 1.6.3`

`rdkit 2020.09.1.0`

`networkx 2.3`

`scikit-learn 0.20.3`

You can install the dependency packages with the following command:

`pip install -r requirements.txt`

### File Folders
* node classification: contains the code of estimating graph pre-training feasibility and pre-traing&fine-tuning data for graph classification

* graph classification: contains the code of estimating graph pre-training feasibility and pre-traing&fine-tuning data for node classification

* utils:contains the code of models.

### Dataset
For the graph classiciation pre-training and downstream dataset, download from pre-training data, unzip it, and put it under graph_classification/data/dataset/

For the node classiciation pre-training dataset, the original datasets are stored in data.bin. And the datasets can be download through pre-training data, unzip it, and put it under node_classification/data/dataset/

### Usage: How to run the code
To run the node_classification, see example below

`python node_classification/estimate_feasiblity.py --pre_data imdb_facebook --down_data h-index`

To run the graph_classification, see example below

`python graph_classification/estimate_feasiblity.py --pre_data zinc_standard_agent --split_num 2 --split_ids 01 --down_data bbbp`
